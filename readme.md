# RT Pollmaster V 2.5.5

- [click here for instructions to install on windows.](https://github.com/RJ1002/pollmaster/blob/slash/setup.md) (work in progress)
- Sorry but this repository is out of date at the moment. I still have plans to update it with what the current bot has but I have not had time to update it. 
also, when I do update it it will not have all of the features that the bot has.

## Overview

With RT Pollmaster you can very easily create and manage complex polls on your server. 

Here is a quick list of features:

- Voting works with reactions (users don't need to type anything)
- Anonymous voting is possible!
- Polls can be single choice, multiple choice or restricted to a specific number of choices
- You can prepare polls in advance and schedule them to a date and time or manually activate them
- Polls can be given a deadline or they can be open until closed manually
- You can restrict which roles are allowed to participate
- You can assign weights to roles to count their votes more or less
- You can hide the current vote count to prevent sheeping
- Polls are persistent and will be available until you delete them
- Personalised info for each poll by reacting with ❔
- ~~Everything can be done in private chat with the bot to reduce spam on the server~~ (been disabled for now)
- Full multi-server support!
- For advanced users: Commandline support to create a full poll in one line -> ~~pm!cmd help~~ or /cmd help

## Getting Started

Users with the server permission "Manage Server" will have all rights from the start, meaning you can get started with ~~pm!new~~ or /new right away!

To grant users without "Manage Server" poll creation access to the bot, create and distribute the role *polladmin* or *polluser*. If you already have roles for these rights you can tell the bot by typing *~~pm!adminrole <your role>~~* or */adminrole* and *~~pm!userrole <your role>~~* or */userrole*.
